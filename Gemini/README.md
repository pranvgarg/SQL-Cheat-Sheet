## 1\. SQL Order of Operations

Understanding the logical order of query execution is crucial for debugging and optimization.

1.  **FROM / JOIN**: Identifies the source tables and how they are joined.
2.  **WHERE**: Filters individual rows based on specified conditions.
3.  **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that share a value in specified columns into summary rows.
4.  **HAVING**: Filters the grouped rows based on aggregate conditions.
5.  **SELECT**: Selects the final columns.
6.  **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
7.  **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set.
8.  **LIMIT / OFFSET**: Restricts the number of rows returned.

**Key Insight:** You cannot use a `SELECT` alias in a `WHERE` clause because `WHERE` is processed before `SELECT`. However, you can use an alias in an `ORDER BY` clause.

  * **This FAILS:**
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_name, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    WHERE total_spent > 1000 -- ERROR: 'total_spent' alias is not yet available
    GROUP BY customer_name;
    ```
  * **This WORKS:**
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_name, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_name
    HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 1000; -- CORRECT: Use HAVING for aggregate filtering
    ```

-----

## 2\. JOINs: Querying Relational Data

JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

| JOIN Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns records that have matching values in both tables. |
| **LEFT JOIN** | Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN**| Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or the right table. |
| **SELF JOIN** | A regular join, but the table is joined with itself. |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables (all possible combinations). |

### Scenarios & Examples

#### Find customers who have placed orders.

  * **Solution (INNER JOIN):**
    ```sql
    SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
    FROM customers c
    INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
    ```

#### Find all customers and any orders they might have.

  * **Solution (LEFT JOIN):** An essential tool for finding what's missing.
    ```sql
    SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
    ```

#### **Interview Question:** "Find customers who have *never* placed an order."

  * **Solution:** Filter for the `NULL` values created by the `LEFT JOIN`.
    ```sql
    SELECT c.customer_name
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
    ```

#### Find employees and their direct managers.

  * **Solution (SELF JOIN):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        e.employee_name AS employee,
        m.employee_name AS manager
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
    ```

-----

## 3\. Aggregation & Grouping: Summarizing Data

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause.

| Function | Description | NULL Handling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COUNT(\*)** | Counts total rows in a group. | Includes `NULL`s. |
| **COUNT(col)** | Counts non-NULL values in a column. | Ignores `NULL`s. |
| **SUM(col)** | Calculates the total sum. | Ignores `NULL`s. |
| **AVG(col)** | Calculates the average. | Ignores `NULL`s. |
| **MIN(col) / MAX(col)** | Finds the minimum/maximum value. | Ignores `NULL`s. |
| **GROUP\_CONCAT(col)** | Aggregates strings from a group into a single string. | Specific to MySQL/PostgreSQL. |

### Scenarios & Examples

#### Get key statistics for each product category.

  * **Solution:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        category,
        COUNT(product_id) AS number_of_products,
        ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price,
        MAX(price) AS highest_price
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category;
    ```

#### Provide a list of all employees in each department.

  * **Solution (GROUP\_CONCAT):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        department,
        GROUP_CONCAT(employee_name ORDER BY employee_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS team_members
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department;
    ```

#### Pivot data using conditional aggregation.

  * **Solution (CASE Statement):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2023 THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2023,
        SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2024 THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2024
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id;
    ```

-----

## 4\. Advanced Filtering: WHERE vs. HAVING

This is a classic interview topic that tests your understanding of the SQL order of operations.

  * **WHERE**: Filters **rows** *before* any groupings or aggregations are performed.
  * **HAVING**: Filters **groups** *after* aggregations have been calculated.

#### **Interview Question:** "From a list of employees, find all departments that have more than 5 employees hired after 2020 and an average salary over $70,000."

  * **Solution:** Use `WHERE` to filter individual employee records first, then `GROUP BY`, and finally use `HAVING` to filter the aggregated groups.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        department,
        COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'  -- 1. Filter rows first
    GROUP BY department             -- 2. Group the remaining rows
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5             -- 3. Filter groups based on aggregates
        AND AVG(salary) > 70000;
    ```

-----

## 5\. Subqueries & CTEs: Composing Complex Queries

### Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested inside another query.

  * **Scalar Subquery**: Returns a single value.
      * **Scenario:** Find products priced above the overall average price.
        ```sql
        SELECT product_name, price
        FROM products
        WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
        ```
  * **Correlated Subquery**: An inner query that depends on the outer query for its values. It is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.
      * **Scenario:** Find employees whose salary is the maximum in their department.
        ```sql
        SELECT employee_name, salary, department_id
        FROM employees e1
        WHERE salary = (
            SELECT MAX(salary)
            FROM employees e2
            WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id -- Correlation
        );
        ```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs create a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They drastically improve the readability and modularity of complex queries.

#### **Interview Question:** "Find the top 3 departments with the highest average employee salary."

  * **Solution (CTE):** Using a CTE makes the logic clear and easy to follow.
    ```sql
    WITH DepartmentAvgSalary AS (
        SELECT
            department,
            AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department
    )
    SELECT
        department,
        avg_salary
    FROM DepartmentAvgSalary
    ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

#### Advanced Example: Recursive CTE

Recursive CTEs are used for querying hierarchical data like organizational charts or bill-of-materials.

  * **Scenario:** Generate an organizational hierarchy path for each employee.
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
        -- Anchor member: employees with no manager (top of the hierarchy)
        SELECT employee_id, employee_name, manager_id, 0 AS level, CAST(employee_name AS CHAR(200)) AS path
        FROM employees
        WHERE manager_id IS NULL

        UNION ALL

        -- Recursive member: joins employees to their managers
        SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1, CONCAT(eh.path, ' -> ', e.employee_name)
        FROM employees e
        INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy ORDER BY level;
    ```

-----

## 6\. Window Functions: Advanced Analytics

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing the result set like `GROUP BY`.

`FUNCTION() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`

### Ranking Functions

| Function | Description | Tie Handling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROW\_NUMBER()**| Assigns a unique sequential number. | Arbitrarily breaks ties. |
| **RANK()** | Assigns rank with gaps for ties (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4). | Gives same rank to ties. |
| **DENSE\_RANK()**| Assigns rank with no gaps (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3). | Gives same rank to ties. |

  * **Scenario**: Rank employees by salary within each department.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        employee_name,
        department,
        salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
    FROM employees;
    ```

### Analytic & Value Functions: `LAG`, `LEAD`, `SUM`

  * `LAG(col, n)` / `LEAD(col, n)`: Access data from `n` rows before/after the current row.
  * `SUM() OVER(...)`: Calculate a cumulative sum or moving total.

#### **Interview Question:** "Calculate the month-over-month percentage growth in revenue."

  * **Solution (LAG):**
    ```sql
    WITH MonthlyRevenue AS (
        SELECT
            DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-01') AS sales_month,
            SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_revenue
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY 1
    )
    SELECT
        sales_month,
        monthly_revenue,
        LAG(monthly_revenue, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month) AS prev_month_revenue,
        ROUND(
            (monthly_revenue - LAG(monthly_revenue, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month)) * 100.0 /
            LAG(monthly_revenue, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month), 2
        ) AS growth_pct
    FROM MonthlyRevenue;
    ```

#### Calculate a 7-day moving average of sales.

  * **Solution (Moving Average):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        daily_sales,
        AVG(daily_sales) OVER (
            ORDER BY sale_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS seven_day_moving_avg
    FROM daily_sales_summary;
    ```

-----

## 7\. Set Operators: Combining Result Sets

| Operator | Description | Duplicate Handling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UNION** | Combines two result sets. | Removes duplicates (slower). |
| **UNION ALL** | Combines two result sets. | Keeps all duplicates (faster). |
| **INTERSECT** | Returns only the rows that appear in both result sets. | Removes duplicates. |
| **EXCEPT** | Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second. | Removes duplicates. |

  * **Pro Tip:** Use `UNION ALL` by default unless you specifically need to remove duplicates, as it offers better performance.

#### Find customers who bought 'Electronics' but not 'Books'.

  * **Solution (EXCEPT):**
    ```sql
    -- Get customers who bought Electronics
    SELECT c.customer_id
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE p.category = 'Electronics'

    EXCEPT -- Subtract the customers who bought books

    -- Get customers who bought Books
    SELECT c.customer_id
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE p.category = 'Books';
    ```

## 8\. Data Manipulation Functions

### String Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CONCAT()** | Joins strings together. | `CONCAT('John', ' ', 'Doe')` |
| **SUBSTRING()**| Extracts a substring. | `SUBSTRING('Database', 5, 4)` -\> 'base' |
| **TRIM()** | Removes leading/trailing whitespace. | `TRIM('  data  ')` -\> 'data' |
| **REPLACE()** | Replaces occurrences of a substring. | `REPLACE('a-b-c', '-', ' ')` -\> 'a b c' |
| **UPPER()/LOWER()**| Changes string case. | `UPPER('Apple')` -\> 'APPLE' |
| **POSITION()** | Finds the starting position of a substring. | `POSITION('@' IN 'user@domain.com')` -\> 5 |

### Datetime Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NOW() / CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP** | Current date and time. | `2025-06-07 23:17:28` |
| **CURDATE() / CURRENT\_DATE** | Current date only. | `2025-06-07` |
| **YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()** | Extracts parts of a date. | `YEAR('2025-01-10')` -\> 2025 |
| **DATE\_ADD() / DATE\_SUB()** | Adds/subtracts a time interval from a date. | `DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)`|
| **DATEDIFF()** | Returns the difference in days between two dates.| `DATEDIFF('2025-01-31', '2025-01-01')` -\> 30 |
| **DATE\_FORMAT()** | Formats a date for display. | `DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%W, %M %e, %Y')` |

### Numeric Functions

`ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`, `ABS()`, `MOD()`.

## 9\. NULL Handling: Managing Missing Data

`NULL` represents missing or unknown data. It is not the same as `0` or an empty string.

  * **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**: The only correct way to check for `NULL` values.
  * **COALESCE(val1, val2, ...)**: Returns the first non-NULL value in the list. Excellent for providing default values.
      * **Scenario:** Display a customer's phone number, defaulting to 'N/A' if none exists.
        ```sql
        SELECT customer_name, COALESCE(phone_number, 'N/A') AS contact
        FROM customers;
        ```
  * **NULLIF(expr1, expr2)**: Returns `NULL` if the two expressions are equal, otherwise returns the first expression. Its primary use is to prevent division-by-zero errors.
      * **Scenario:** Safely calculate sales goal achievement percentage.
        ```sql
        SELECT total_sales / NULLIF(target_sales, 0) AS achievement_pct
        FROM sales_performance;
        ```
  * **Aggregation and NULLs**: Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` ignore `NULL` values. `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, while `COUNT(column)` only counts rows where `column` is not `NULL`.

## 10\. Advanced Concepts & Professional Techniques

### Indexing

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. While you don't write indexes in a query, understanding them is key to performance optimization.

  * **Concept**: An index on a column (e.g., `customer_id`) allows the database to find a specific customer's rows much faster, avoiding a full table scan.
  * **Interview Angle**: "How would you improve the performance of a slow query?" A common answer is "Add an index to the columns used in the `JOIN` or `WHERE` clauses."

### Transactions and ACID Properties

A transaction is a single unit of work. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties guarantee that transactions are processed reliably.

  * **Concept**: Wrapping multiple statements (e.g., deducting from one account and adding to another) in a transaction ensures that either all steps succeed or none do (`COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`).
  * **Interview Angle**: Shows you understand data integrity, which is critical in application development.

### PIVOT

Pivoting rotates a table by turning unique values from one column into multiple columns in the output.

  * **Scenario:** Transform a `sales` table with rows for each product into a summary with a column for each product's total sales.
  * **Solution (Using CASE - works in all DBs):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        order_date,
        SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'Electronics' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Electronics,
        SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'Clothing' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Clothing,
        SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'Home Goods' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Home_Goods
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY order_date;
    ```

### Lateral Joins

A `LATERAL` join (or `CROSS APPLY`/`OUTER APPLY` in SQL Server) is a powerful feature that allows a derived table (right-hand side) to reference columns from a table expression on its left.

  * **Scenario**: For each department, find the top 2 highest-paid employees.
  * **Solution (PostgreSQL / Oracle):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        d.department_name,
        top_employees.employee_name,
        top_employees.salary
    FROM departments d,
    LATERAL (
        SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary
        FROM employees e
        WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
        ORDER BY e.salary DESC
        LIMIT 2
    ) AS top_employees;
    ```

## 11\. Common Interview Questions & Solutions

### Question 1: Find the Nth Highest Salary

"Find the second highest salary from the `employees` table."

  * **Solution (DENSE\_RANK):** This is the most robust method as it handles ties correctly.
    ```sql
    WITH SalaryRanks AS (
        SELECT
            salary,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
        FROM employees
    )
    SELECT salary
    FROM SalaryRanks
    WHERE rnk = 2;
    ```

### Question 2: Find Duplicate Records

"Find all duplicate email addresses in the `customers` table."

  * **Solution (GROUP BY & HAVING):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        email,
        COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
    FROM customers
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```

### Question 3: Find Users with Consecutive Logins

"Find users who logged in on at least three consecutive days."

  * **Solution (Window Functions):** This is a challenging problem that elegantly showcases the power of window functions. The trick is to group by the difference between the date and a generated row number. Consecutive dates will have the same difference.
    ```sql
    WITH LoginGroups AS (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            login_date,
            DATE_SUB(login_date, INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) DAY) as grp
        FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_id, login_date FROM user_logins) AS distinct_logins
    )
    SELECT user_id, MIN(login_date) AS streak_start, MAX(login_date) as streak_end, COUNT(*) as consecutive_days
    FROM LoginGroups
    GROUP BY user_id, grp
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
    ```s
