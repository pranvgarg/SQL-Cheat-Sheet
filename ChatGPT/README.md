## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Logical Execution Model

Order in which SQL processes queries:

```sql
FROM ‚Üí JOIN ‚Üí WHERE ‚Üí GROUP BY ‚Üí HAVING ‚Üí WINDOW ‚Üí SELECT ‚Üí DISTINCT ‚Üí ORDER BY ‚Üí LIMIT/OFFSET
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regular Expressions in SQL

* `[a-z]`: Lowercase letters
* `[A-Z]`: Uppercase letters
* `[0-9]`: Digits
* `[a-zA-Z0-9]`: Alphanumeric

Examples:

```sql
WHERE column REGEXP '^a'     -- Starts with 'a'
WHERE column REGEXP 'z$'     -- Ends with 'z'
WHERE column REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}$' -- Exactly 3 digits
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ String Functions and Manipulation

Trimming & Padding:

```sql
TRIM(' abc ') ‚Üí 'abc'
LPAD('123',5,'0') ‚Üí '00123'
```

Substring & Replace:

```sql
SUBSTR('abcdef',2,3) ‚Üí 'bcd'
REPLACE('a-b-c','-','+') ‚Üí 'a+b+c'
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Date and Time Handling

Extraction:

```sql
YEAR(date), MONTH(date), DAY(date)
```

Date Arithmetic:

```sql
NOW() - INTERVAL 3 DAY
```

Difference:

```sql
DATEDIFF('2024-12-31','2024-01-01') ‚Üí 365
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Arithmetic Operations

* Division: `5/2 ‚Üí 2`
* Modulo: `5%2 ‚Üí 1`
* Round: `ROUND(12.345,2) ‚Üí 12.35`
* Floor/Ceiling: `FLOOR(3.9) ‚Üí 3`

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Type Conversions

```sql
CAST('123' AS INT) ‚Üí 123
CAST('2024-03-01' AS DATE)
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregations and GROUP BY

Aggregations:

```sql
COUNT(*), SUM(col), AVG(col)
```

Grouping examples:

```sql
SELECT dept, GROUP_CONCAT(emp ORDER BY emp SEPARATOR ',') FROM employees GROUP BY dept;
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Window Functions

Ranking:

```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)
```

Moving averages:

```sql
AVG(salary) OVER (ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Simple CTE:

```sql
WITH sales AS (SELECT date, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY date)
SELECT * FROM sales;
```

---

## üîü Recursive Queries

Hierarchy tree example:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE emp_tree AS (
 SELECT id, manager_id FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
 UNION ALL
 SELECT e.id, e.manager_id FROM employees e JOIN emp_tree et ON e.manager_id = et.id
) SELECT * FROM emp_tree;
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling NULL Values

```sql
COALESCE(col,'default')
WHERE col IS NULL
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Operators

* `UNION`: Combines without duplicates
* `UNION ALL`: Combines with duplicates
* `INTERSECT`: Common rows
* `EXCEPT`: Rows in first set not in second

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Joins and Their Types

Inner, left, right, full outer, self, cross join explained with examples.

```sql
SELECT a.*, b.* FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Filtering (WHERE vs HAVING)

```sql
WHERE col = 'value' -- Row level filter
HAVING COUNT(col) > 1 -- Group level filter
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Anonymous and Nested Queries

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM table) AS sub;
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Optimization Techniques

* Indexing
* Using EXPLAIN
* SARGable predicates

```sql
WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging and Common Mistakes

* Avoid `SELECT *`
* Avoid using functions on indexed columns in WHERE
* Use LIMIT to debug queries quickly
* Always check EXPLAIN for query plans

Example mistake:

```sql
-- BAD
SELECT * FROM users WHERE YEAR(birth_date) = 1990
-- GOOD
SELECT * FROM users WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1990-12-31'
```

‚úÖ **Final Review Checklist:**

* [ ] Check for NULL handling
* [ ] Verify indexes and joins
* [ ] Confirm query logic
* [ ] Test edge cases thoroughly
* [ ] Optimize for readability and performance
